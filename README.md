# AirBnB_clone

## First step: Write a command interpreter to manage your AirBnB objects.

### The project tasks are linked and will:

####    put in place a parent class (called BaseModel) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of your future instances
####    create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file
####    create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Place…) that inherit from BaseModel
####    create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.
####    create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine
